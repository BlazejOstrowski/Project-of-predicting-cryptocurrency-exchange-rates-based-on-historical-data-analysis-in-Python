# Project-of-predicting-cryptocurrency-exchange-rates-based-on-historical-data-analysis-in-Python
This is a project of predicting cryptocurrency exchange rates based on historical data analysis in Python

The aim of the project is to conduct research on the behavior of the cryptocurrency market. The project includes an analysis of the behavior of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the global market. For this purpose, a general reconnaissance of the cryptocurrency market was carried out, consisting of checking the market capitalization or the share of the hundred most popular cryptocurrencies on the market. An analysis of Bitcoin was also performed as the main cryptocurrency that has a significant share in the cryptocurrency market and affects the prices of other digital assets. Bitcoin's behavior was checked in relation to the most important events in the world and other interesting factors. Data from different cryptocurrencies were also compared to verify the relationships between them. The project also includes an analysis in relation to real assets on the stock exchange such as the S&P 500 index, the Dollar index, or the price of gold and silver. Data exploration techniques such as clustering using various algorithms, principal component analysis (PCA), and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) were also used in the analysis.
